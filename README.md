# UX Designer Nanodegree

This is the list of projects I did for my [UX Designer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ux-designer-nanodegree--nd578).

Graduated on **On Process (will be graduate by the end of October)**

## Project 1 - UX Fundamentals & Design Research

This project was about developing a discussion guide, recruit research participants, and synthesize findings in the form of a research report.
The goal of this project is to ask the right questions when interviewing users to understand their experiences in order to identify design opportunities, 
and create initial sketches that incorporate design psychology principles.

## Project 2 - Concept to Low-Fidelity Prototyping

This project was about taking a product idea through the design sprint process to come up with a user-tested low-fidelity prototype of your solution.
Then, go through ideation exercises to create paper sketches, and digital prototypes based off the paper sketches. 
Lastly, conduct a usability test of your prototype with users to validate design assumptions, 
and create a second iteration of the prototype based on user feedback.

Technologies: Figma.com, Mirro.io
